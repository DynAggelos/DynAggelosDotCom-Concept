            <p class="card-text">This is a web-based program that runs interely in JavaScript. The GTPC allows users to convert text between Unicode Greek characters and so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_code" target="_blank">beta code</a> Greek characters. This program was used to convert Robinson and Pierpont's Greek New Testament from beta code to Unicode, as the text was only available in its original public domain version online in beta code. A pure, unadulterated, public domain copy of the Robinson-Pierpont GNT can now be found in Unicode <a href="http://www.projects.biblicalwiki.com/RP/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

            <p class="card-text">This is a website for teachers who are interested in using Minecraft as a teaching platform for programming. The website acts as a syllabus, and also the gateway to a curriculum website for students to access (student access is through links the instructor sends by email, and is not intended to be browsable). The course is an extended two-year course intended for children ages 13-15 (when the course first begins). Topics covered during the course include: programming logic, conditions, loops, variables, functions, data types, and even arrays. This is a long-term project course, giving students the chance to see what it's like to program "in the real world", and what it's like to finish a long-term project.</p>

            <p class="card-text">The curriculum is currently being developed and tested.</p>

            <p class="card-text">A wiki for biblical topics, ranging from Bible characters to biology. By "biblical topics", I mean any topic which is related to the Bible, Christianity, or the biblical world-view. Unlike most wiki's, BiblicalWiki.com primarily contains content which has been expressly submitted and/or resubmitted to the public domain, allowing anyone to use that content for any purpose whatsoever. The aim is not only to help the casual browser looking for information, but also the content developer looking for a source to glean from. Why? Because accessible information is the source-code of education, and what can be more accessible than public domain content on the Web?</p>
